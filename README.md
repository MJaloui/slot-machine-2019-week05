## Project Overview

This is a classic browser-based slot machine game featuring three reels with five unique lollipop symbols. It includes a dynamic betting system and a real-time score tracker, allowing users to play until their coins run out. The game's state is reset upon refreshing the browser, offering a fresh start for every play session.

## Core Features

* Spin the three reels to land on winning combinations.
* Place bets with a minimum and maximum coin option.
* Watch your score update automatically after each spin.
* The game automatically ends when all coins have been used.

## Technologies

* **HTML:** Structuring the game interface and the slot machine reels.
* **CSS:** Styling the visual elements, including the reels and spin animations.
* **JavaScript:** Handling all game logic, from managing bets and scores to handling win/loss conditions.

## Key Learnings

This project was an excellent opportunity to strengthen my skills in frontend game development, specifically:
* Dynamically updating the user interface and manipulating the DOM with **JavaScript**.
* Implementing game logic and win conditions using **conditional statements**.
* Managing variables for user data such as coins and bets.
